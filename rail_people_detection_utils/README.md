# RAIL People Detection Utils

Common utility functions for person detection live here. Such utilities include:

- [`position_mapper`](src/rail_people_detection_utils/): Maps a centroid in a camera image into a 3D position based on the point cloud corresponding to that image.

The utility functions in this package are not nodes in and of themselves; they are meant to be used as libraries to assist in person (or person feature) detection within other packages.
